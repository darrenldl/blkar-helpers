# rsbx-helpers

Helper scripts/programs for using rsbx

## Notes on stability

Helpers are maintained and developed on a best effort basis, and are not heavily tested, while the core program rsbx itself is heavily tested and is expected to always work.

When in doubt or when you need to be very certain things do work, invoke rsbx directly.

## Index

- Uses Python 3 + FUSE to encoding files using blkar
- Heavily inspired by [Thanassis Tsiodras's Reed-Solomon FS](https://www.thanassis.space/rsbep.html)
